## Classes Overview

### 1. `Product`
Represents a product with:
- `id`: Unique product ID.
- `name`: Product name.
- `price`: Product price.
- `stock`: Available stock quantity.
- `weight`: For calculating shipping cost.

### 2. `ShoppingBasket`
Handles:
- Adding products to the basket.
- Calculating the total price of items.

### 3. `Payment` (Abstract Class)
Base class for payment methods. Derived classes:
- **`CreditCardPayment`**: Handles payments via credit card.
- **`EFTPayment`**: Handles payments via EFT/Transfer.

### 4. `ShipmentMethod` (Interface)
Defines a method for calculating shipping costs. Implementations:
- **`StandardShipment`**: Shipping cost = weight √ó 1.0
- **`ExpressShipment`**: Shipping cost = weight √ó 1.5
- **`SpecialShipment` : Shipping cost = weight √ó 2.0

## Future Enhancements

- Add more products dynamically from the user.
- Implement persistent storage for products and transactions.
- Add user authentication for secure payments.

## My Contributions

This was a collaborative project, and my personal contributions included:

- Designing and implementing the `Product` class structure.
- Developing the abstract `Payment` system and its subclasses (`CreditCardPayment`, `EFTPayment`).
- Creating the `Main.java` file, which handles program execution and user interaction flow.
